# Problem Statement

Rock–Paper–Scissors is a simple turn-based game commonly used to teach basic logic and decision making.  
For students who are new to programming and AI, this game provides a clear, easy-to-understand example of  
how computer systems can follow rules to make decisions.

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional, console-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game in Python  
that allows the user to play against the computer. The computer’s move should be generated randomly, the  
winner should be determined based on predefined rules, and the system should keep track of the score.

# Scope of the Project

- Implement a clean, rule-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game.
- Support “Best-of-N” gameplay where N is chosen by the user.
- Handle user input safely with validation.
- Display round results and scores clearly.
- Use randomness to generate CPU moves.
- Provide an option to save the final match summary into a text file.
- Maintain a modular structure by using separate Python files.

# Objectives

- Understand how rule-based systems work.
- Learn to break code into modules.
- Practice user interaction using input/output.
- Implement decision-making using conditional statements.
- Gain basic experience with file handling and documentation.
